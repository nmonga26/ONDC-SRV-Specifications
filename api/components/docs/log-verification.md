### File Naming conventions:

1. **Single Endpoint Naming**:

   - For a single API endpoint, the file name should precisely match the name of the endpoint. For example:
     - search: search.json (for the "search" endpoint)
     - on_search: on_search.json (for the "on_search" endpoint)
2. **Multiple Calls for Same Endpoint**:

   - When there are multiple API calls for the same endpoint, the naming convention should reflect the sequence of calls using numeric suffixes:
     - select 1: select_1.json (for the first call of the "select" endpoint)
     - select 2: select_2.json (for the second call of the "select" endpoint)
     - status 1: status_1.json (for the first call of the "status" endpoint)
     - status 2: status_2.json (for the second call of the "status" endpoint)

These naming conventions ensure clear identification and organization of files based on the corresponding API endpoints and their respective calls.
