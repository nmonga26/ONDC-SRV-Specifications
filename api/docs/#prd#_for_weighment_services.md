Broadcasting to Sellers Request broadcast:** The intent is broadcast from the buyer app to relevant seller apps (weighbridge operators) via the gateway. **3\. Seller Response** Sellers analyze the request and provide the following details in their response: **Weighbridge details:** **Weighing Capacity** 0-10 MT 30 MT 40 MT Etc (No Enums) Cohort may refine these options **Weight Type :** Unloaded or Loaded **Company Name** : Name of the Weighment Company **Location** : Location of the weighbridge where in weighing will take place **Number of Wheels**: The number of wheels that the truck can have. For e.g Trucks with wheels less than 16 are only allowed. **Dimension** : The size of the trucks that are accepted/allowed for weighment. For e.g. Only trucks that are smaller than 10 ft in height are allowed. L \= Max Length B \= Max Breadth H \= Max height of the truck that can weighed **Weighment Type Automatic** : The weighbridge automatically records Gross & Tare & Net Weight. A printed receipt is generated. **Manual** : The Weights needs to be calculated manually **Images** of the weighbridge **Slot availability:** Specific time slots for weighing. **Pricing:** Rates for weighing services, inclusive of any add-ons. **Policies:** Checklist of required documents (Optional) Invoice of the Material (Optional) Company Proof ID proof Vehicle details ..

Case 1: If buyer app collects payment and initiates the confirmation call Pre Fulfilment On Fulfilment Case 2: If seller app collects payment, seller app provides its payment collection details and shares confirmation on the payment successful post confirmation initiation received from the buyer app Pre Fulfilment On Fulfilment **6\. Post Order Activities** On the scheduled date and time, the Buyer arrives at the weighbridge with their produce. The operator verifies the Buyer’s booking and required details. The weighment process: **Step 1:** Gross weight is recorded with a loaded vehicle.
